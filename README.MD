This programm solves a common problem with certain e-drum sets
which do not send any MIDI *NOTE OFF* command what 
make a note last for ever.
Every note that is played will consume the total available polyphony and 
the DAW will not play any note from there on.

I have been confronted with this issue in Logic Pro X 
with the e-drum set Millenium HD-120

This programm adds to every MIDI *NOTE ON* command 
received from the target input device
an additional MIDI *NOTE OFF* command

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å
